Introduction
At X Education, one of the biggest challenges is converting leads into actual enrollments. Right now, the conversion rate sits at just 30%, making it tough for the sales team to work efficiently and close more deals. To solve this, we built a Logistic Regression model that assigns a lead score, helping the team focus on high-potential leads and aim for an improved 80% conversion rate.

This project is all about data-driven decision-making. By analyzing key factors that influence conversions, we can optimize sales efforts, reduce manual work, and ultimately improve business performance.
