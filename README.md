# Case Study: Improvisation of X Education’s Lead Conversion Rate

Let us discuss how we are trying to improve at X Education’s lead conversion rates by creating a model which predicts the probabilities of converting an inquiry into admission to the point of actually converting it into a sale. Our aim is to discover the main predictors of successful lead conversion and develop programs that help sales personnel maximize their efforts during different phases of the business period.

1. *Greater Contributing Factors*: While estimate planning using the logic regression model, the leading three factors for the possibility of lead conversion with the highest potential odds of a lead getting converted were noted. These attributes also highlight the key features which deeply impact the lead conversion and suggests ways to boost sales efforts. 

2. *Important Dummy Variables*: Looking at the model, there are top three lead conversion rates dummy variables that need attention and prompt action that came out from the models was biased. These factors form the basis for focused marketing and effective spending of resources.

3.With the monthly internship program, the company recruits interns to help the sales department. A recommendation has been made to pursue a ‘more aggressive’ strategy for lead conversion. This will include concentrating on those leads that are predicted to have high conversion probability in the model and classed as 1 using the dedicated calling campaign to reach do so. This guarantees approach completes the max conversion during the high sales phase.

4.Shifting Priorities to a More Conservative Strategy: When the company achieves its quarterly targets early, there will be a shift to a more conservative approach. This approach will be intended to focus on reducing the number of calls made by fine tuning the lead pool to cover only those that are most likely to be notated as useful and followed up on. It avoids wasted efforts from the sales team and allows them time to focus on more important matters.
